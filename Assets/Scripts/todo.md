_____

The Noongar name for magpie is Koorlbardi, also spelled Kulbardi, Koolbardi or Kooldjak. The Whadjuck Noongar people are from the Perth area of Western Australia.

There are nine different subspecies of magpies across Australia. Their plumage varies across these subspecies, including the amount of white feathering on their back.

Australian magpies are known for their aggressive swooping during breeding season, however only about 8 to 10 percent of magpies swoop people.

It is typically the male Australian magpie that defends the nest and swoops during breeding season, which peaks between August and November.

_____


Australian Magpie females lay three to five blue or green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation time: 20 days.

The chicks are fed by their mother and have feathers and are ready to fly in about four weeks.

Within 2 years, the young magpies are forced by their parents to leave the territory. They join a group until they can gain a place in a territory as an adult breeding bird. 

The nest is a platform of sticks and twigs (occasionally wire), with a small interior bowl lined with grass and hair. The nest is constructed in the outer branches of a tree, up to 15 m above the ground.


When alone, a magpie will make a quiet, musical warbling noise, which does not carry for long distances. Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling, known as carrolling, which they use to announce or defend their territory. Fledgling and juvenile magpies emit a repeated, short high-pitched begging call. When they feel threatened, magpies will emit several high-pitched alarm calls.

The Australian magpie produces a loud musical flute-like song, often performed as a duet or by groups.

The Australian Magpie walks along the ground searching for insects and their larvae.

Groups of up to 24 birds live year round in territories that are actively defended by all group members.

Australian Magpies are found wherever there is a combination of trees and adjacent open areas, including parks and playing fields. They are absent only from the densest forests and arid deserts.

The Australian Magpie is black and white, but the plumage pattern varies across its range. Its nape, upper tail and shoulder are white in males, grey in females. Across most of Australia, the remainder of the body is black. In the south-east, centre, extreme south-west and Tasmania, the back and rump are entirely white. The eye of adult birds is chestnut brown.

their pitch may vary over up to four octaves.

but it is usually the males that defend the nest during breeding season.

Magpies can hold a territory in excess of ten years and have a lifespan of 25-30 years.

Magpies are intelligent birds, able to recognise up to 100 individual people and will swoop riders from 50-100 metres away from their nest!

Its closest relatives are Australian birds like the currawong and butcherbird. All of these birds belong to the family Cracticidae.

They tilt their heads to listen for worms underground before striking the ground. During foraging, these birds momentarily pause and slightly lower their heads to listen for worms or insects burrowing below. Once they hear something, they immediately pound the ground with their beaks to capture their prey.

A group of magpies is called a tribe or "tidings." 

Magpies usually mate for life. If a male dies while there are chicks in the nest, the female will find a new mate, and he will protect the young, even if not biologically related
